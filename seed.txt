DATBASE MIGRATION WILL RUNN SEEDING ALSO

**I THINK WHEN YOU WANT TO USE PRODUCTION YOU SHOULD REMOVE THAT SEEDING OPTION INSIDE package.json**

THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR US SO FOR NOW TILL WE FOUND BETTER SOLUTION

COMMENT OUT (TEMPORRARY REMOVE) THIS LINE

```
"prisma": {
    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  },
```

FROM package.json

IF YOU WANT TO USE STAGING DATABASE

NOW IT IS SAFE TO MIGRATE: SAFE TO RUN `yarn prisma:migrate:prod` AND YOU WON'T GET ERRORS
