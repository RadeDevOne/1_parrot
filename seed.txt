DATBASE MIGRATION WILL RUNN SEEDING ALSO

THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR US SO FOR NOW TILL WE FOUND BETTER SOLUTION

COMMENT OUT (TEMPORRARY REMOVE) THIS LINE

```
"prisma": {
    "seed": "ts-node prisma/seed.ts"
  },
```

NOW IT IS SAFE TO MIGRATE: SAFE TO RUN `yarn prisma:migrate:prod` AND YOU WON'T GET ERRORS
