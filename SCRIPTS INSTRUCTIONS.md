# TESTING

- TEST WITHOUT POSTGRES DATABASE, AND TEST IN WATCH MODE

`yarn test`

**WITH DATBASE**

- TEST WITH ONLY PUSHING SCHEMA (WITHOUT SEEDING)

`yarn pg:test`

- TEST WITH SEEDING TO THE DATBASE

`yarn pg:test:seed`

I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE FOR TESTING

***

**IMPORTANT: IF CONTAINER WITH DATBASE IS STILL LIVE EVEN TEST FINISHED, TRY STOPING IT FIRST WITH:**

`docker-compose down`

IF THAT DOESN;T WORK TRY: `docker kill <name of cont>`

***

# DEVELOPMENT

START DEVELOPMENT WITH SEEDED POSGRESS INSTANCE

`yarn d`

THE REST YOU CAN FIGURE IT ON YOUR OWN

`yarn dev` IS JUST NEXTJS APP
