# WE ARE GOING TO USE REDIS, BECAUSE IN MY APP I WANT TO DEFINE QUEUES

I THINK THIS WILL SOLVE SOME CONCURRENCY PROBLEMS

AGAIN, IDEA IS TO HAVE REDIS ON SOME CLOUD PROVIDER (MAYBE [UPSTASH](https://docs.upstash.com/) FOR PRODUCTION AND **TO HAVE LOCAL REDIS INSTANCE THROUGH DOCKER CONTAINER**)

OK, HELPFUL RESOURCES FOR THIS TIME ARE: [OFFICIAL DOCS OF UPSTASH](https://docs.upstash.com/)

ALSO LEE ROBINSON USES REDIS WITH UPSTASH SO WE CAN CONSULT [HIS BLOG POST](https://leerob.io/blog/serverless-redis-nextjs) AND [HIS VIDEO ALSO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FytxaSVQROc)


<!-- ## STYLING

USING TAILWIND TOGETHER WITH EMOTION (**TWIN MACRO BY ben-rogerson**)

twin.macro with emotion (explained)

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-emotion>


typescript emotion example (very nice, has more stuff) (maybe is missing something but it is a good starter to build upon):

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-emotion-typescript>

**THESE ARE THE DOCS FOR TWIN MACRO**

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/tree/master/docs>

**MUST READ**: (UNDER RESOURCS)

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro#resources>

MOST IMPORTAT THING (AT LEAST FOR ME): USE `css={[tw``]}` FOR DYNAMIC STYLES, AND USE `tw=""` OTHERVISE

## ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS

FRAMER MOTION (SOMETIMES I DON'T LIKE HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IT TENDS TO RANDOMLY SETS display PROPERTY) (IF YOU ARE ANIMATING SIZES)

## COLOR MODE

next-themes

# STATE MANGEMENT

xstate @xstate/react

# AUTHENTICATION

next-auth

# DATABASE

PRODUCTION: `PostgreSQL 13.3` ON `Supabase`

DEVELOPMENT: `PostgreSQL 13.3` SPINNED UP WITH DOCKER

ORM: Prisma

## IDEAS

`WE SHOULD BUILD ECHO API (LIKE A STREAMING SERVER BUT MANUAL)`

WE SHOULD PUT CART IN A DETABSE, INSTEAD OF LOCAL STORAGE (BECAUSE IF WE USE THIS SERVER SIDE WE CAN EXPIRE CART, WE CAN DESTROY CART OBJECT)

ORDER MARKED AS EXPIRED

CHECKING STOCK

CHECKING STOCK EVERY TIME USERS ADD TO CART

WHEN SEEDING YOU SHOULD SHOW ONE PRODUCT NOT IN STOCK AND THEN ONE PRODUCT IN STOCK AND SO ON AND SO ON (FOR EASIER DEVELOPMENT)
