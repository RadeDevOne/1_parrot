# DEVELOPMENT DATABASE

WE ARE GOING TO USE POSTGRESQL DATBASE WITH PRISMA

WE WILL USE ONE DATABASE FOR DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER FOR PRODUCTION

WE CAN SPECIFY URLS OF THESE DATBASES INSIDE `.env.production.local` AND `.env.development.local`

**PRISMA NEEDS `DATABASE_URL` SO WE ARE GOING TO SET THAT**

**FOR PRODUCTION WE ARE USING `SUPABASE` POSTGRES DATABASE SO I TOOK A URL FROM DASBOARD AND INSERTED INSIDE STRING SO OUR ENV VARIABLE IS LOOKING LIKE THIS**

```
cat .env.production.local
```

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD YOU ADDED WHEN YOU CREATED SUPABASE PROJECT]@db.dsgdgkgkfhfgd.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

AND THAT IS IT FOR PRODUCTION

I ALREADY RUNNED EVERYTHING TO TEST THAT WE CAN CONNECT TO PRODUCTION DATBASE

WHAT I DID IS:

I BACKED UP gitignore BECAUSE THIS COMMAND TENDS TO OVERWRITE IT (SO I CAN PUT IT BACK AFTER RUNNING THE COMMAND)

```
npx prisma init
```

**THIS GENERATED PRISMA STUFF IN OUR PROJECT, AND I ADDED SOME THINGS INSIDE SCHEMA**

I ADDED SOME THINGS IN A SCHEMA (SOME next-auth STUFF)

LETS PUSH THOSE CHANGES

```
yarn prisma:db:push:prod
```

EVERYTHING WENT WELL (I OPENED DASBORD OF OUR PROJECT ON SUPABASE.IO AND IN DATABASE SECTION I FOUN OUR TABLES LISTED)

## FOR DEVELOPMENT WE ARE GOING TO USE POSTGRESQL INSTANCE THAT IS RUNNING INSIDE DOCKER CONTAINER, SO YOU NEED TO INSTAL DOCKER

[HOW TO INSTALL DOCKER YOU CAN SEE HERE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) (DON'T FORGET TO RUN [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/))) (TRY USING WITH sudo IF SOMETHING GETS WRONG)

WHEN WE DID THAT LETS RUN CONTAINER WITH POSTGRES INSTANCE

**BUT BEFORE THAT LETS FIND OUT WHAT VERSION OF POSTGRES SUPABASE USES, BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT DATBASES WITH SAME VERSIONS**

GO TO THE DASBOARD OF YOUR SUPABASE PROJECT AND **GO TO `SQL EDITOR` CLICK ON `+ New Query` AND RUN THIS QUERY**

```sql
SELECT version();
```

YOU WILL GET THE VERSION

AT TIME I WAS DOING THIS VERSION WAS `13.3`

SO WE AARE GOING TO USE SAME VERSION FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT DATBASE

IF YOU FORGOT HOW TO RUN POSTGRES INSTANCE WITH DOCKER [CHECK THIS](https://github.com/Rade58/databases-playground/tree/1_0_1_PostgreSQL)

***
IMPORTANT!!

**RUN docker COMMANDS WITH `sudo` IF YOU GET PERMISSION ERROR**

***

```
sudo docker run --name fancy-parrot -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=schism -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.3
```

```
sudo docker ps
```

WE HAVE A RUNNING CONTAINER

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS                                       NAMES
49719ebf4e4f   postgres:13.3   "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   22 seconds ago   Up 19 seconds   0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp   fancy-parrot
```

## LETS FORM A LINK FOR OUR DEVELOPMENT DATABASE

THIS IS A TEMPLATE: `postgresql://${user}:${pass}@localhost:5432/${dbName}`

SO OUR LINK IS: (WE DIDN'T SPECIFY USERNAME SO WE WILL PUT `postgres` AS A USER)

**PURPOSLY I ADDED NEW NAME FOR THE DATBASE (fancy-parrot)** (JUST TO HO W THAT YOU CAN)

`postgresql://postgres:schism@localhost:5432/fancy-parrot`

**LETS SPECIFY THIS LINK AS A ENVIROMENT VARIIABLE INSIDE `.env.development.local`**

```
code .env.development.local
```

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:schism@localhost:5432/fancy-parrot
```

# WE HAVE A DEVELOPMENT DATBASE RUNNING INSIDE OF CONTAINER (I ALSO ADDED SOME THINGS IN SCHEMA AND EARLIER (I EXPLAINED THAT)), LETS NOW PUSH OUR CHANGES

THIS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING (WE DIDN'T RUN INITIALIZATION COMMAND BECAUSE WE ALREADY DID THAT HEN WE WERE DOING THINGS AROUND PRODUCTION DATABASE)

I WROTE A SCRIPT SO WE CAN PUSH SCHEMA STUFF TO DEVELOPMENT DATBASE ONLY

```
yarn prisma:db:push:dev
```

LETS NOW OPEN DATABASE SHELL (I MEAN `psql`) TO SEE IF WE HAVE TABLES ACORDING TO SCHEMA

```
sudo docker exec -it -u postgres fancy-parrot psql
```

WE ARE INSIDE SHELL

LETS CONNECT TO A DATABASE

```
\l
```

```
\c fancy-parrot
```

LETS LIST IF WE HAVE SOME TABLES

```
\d
```

AND THIS IS A VITNESING THAT OUR PRISMA SCHEMA DID ACTUALLY APPLIED ON OUR DEVELOPMENT DATABASE

```
                List of relations
 Schema |        Name         | Type  |  Owner   
--------+---------------------+-------+----------
 public | Account             | table | postgres
 public | Session             | table | postgres
 public | User                | table | postgres
 public | VerificationRequest | table | postgres
(4 rows)
```

WE CAN EXIT FROM A SHELL RIGHT NOW

```
\q
```

OK, WE ARE NOW GOING TO STOP CONTAINER WITH OUR POSTGRES INSTANCE

```shell
# to list running containers
sudo docker ps
# AND TO STOP A CONTAINER
sudo docker kill <container id>
# WE CAN USE stop TO BUT kill IS BETTER
# AND YOU CAN GOOGLE IT WHY IS IT BETTER
```

I STOPED IT BECAUSE I WANT TO WRITE A NPM SCRIPT

## LETS WRITE NPM SCRIPT FOR RUNNING A COUNTAINER WITH POSTGRES INSTANCE, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO USE THIS FREQUENTLY

```
code package.json
```

```json
// ADDED THIS "script"
"db:dev": "sudo docker run --name fancy-parrot -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=schism -p 5432:5432 -d --rm postgres:13.3",
```

LETS TRY IT

```
yarn db:dev
```

IT STARTED BUT LETS ALSO MAKE A SCRIPT FOR ACCESSINGPOSTGRES SHELL (WHEN I SAY POSTGRES SHELL I ACTUALLY MEAN OF `psql`)

```
code package.json
```

```json
// ADDED THIS "script"
"db:dev:psql": "sudo docker exec -it -u postgres fancy-parrot psql",
```

LETS TRY IT

```
yarn db:dev:psql
```

WE ARI NSIDE, BUT OUR DATABASE

```sh
# 
\l
# 
\c fancy-parrot

FATAL:  database "fancy-parrot" does not exist
Previous connection kept

#
\q
```

I'LL REXPLAIN WHY

# SINCE EVERY TIME WE KILL THE CONTAINER, OUR POSTGRES INSTANCE IS DESTROYED 

REMBER WE ADDED DATBASE NAME TO A CONNECTIO NSTRING, AND `PRISMA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING DATABASE, AND CREATING TABLES ACORDING TO SCHEMA/`

AND THAT IS HAPPENING WHEN WE RUN COMMAND I ALREADY MENTIOND, WHICH WE ARE GOING TO RUN JUST NOW

```
yarn prisma:db:push:dev
```

THIS IS GOING TO CREATE DATBASE WITH A NAME WE SPECIFIED IN CONNECTION STRING (WHICH IS INSIDE `.env.development.local` FILE)

ANT IT IS GOING TO CREATE TABLES WE SPECIFIED INSIDE `prisma/schema.prisma`

OK LETS CONNECT WITH psql AND CHECK IF EVERYTHING IS CREATED

```
yarn db:dev:psql
```

```zsh
\l
# NOW OUR DATBASE IS LISTED
# AND WE CAN CONNECT AND CHECK RELTIONS (TABLES)
\c fancy-parrot
# 
\d

# WE GOT THIS

                List of relations
 Schema |        Name         | Type  |  Owner   
--------+---------------------+-------+----------
 public | Account             | table | postgres
 public | Session             | table | postgres
 public | User                | table | postgres
 public | VerificationRequest | table | postgres
(4 rows)
```

# NOW WE CAN WRITE CONNECTION LOGIC, OR HOW TO CONNECT TO OUR DATBASES FROM NODEJS, OR NEXTJS WORLD; WE ARE GOING TO USE PRISMA CLIENT

WE DON'T NEED ANY CONDITIOS IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION ENVIROMENTS, SINCE BY HAVING `.env.development.local` AND `.env.production.local`, IN WHICH WE HAVE ENV VARIABLE WITH A SAME NAME `DATBASE_URL` WE KNOW THAT PRISMA CLIENT WILL GET THE RIGHT CONNECTION STRING IN A RIGHT ENVIROMENT

```
mkdir -p lib/prisma && touch lib/prisma/index.ts
```

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

let prisma: PrismaClient;

// eslint-disable-next-line
declare namespace global {
  let prisma: PrismaClient;
}

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  prisma = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }

  prisma = global.prisma;
}

export default prisma;
```

## STYLING

USING TAILWIND TOGETHER WITH EMOTION (**TWIN MACRO BY ben-rogerson**)

twin.macro with emotion (explained)

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-emotion>


typescript emotion example (very nice, has more stuff) (maybe is missing something but it is a good starter to build upon):

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-emotion-typescript>

**THESE ARE THE DOCS FOR TWIN MACRO**

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/tree/master/docs>

**MUST READ**: (UNDER RESOURCS)

<https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro#resources>

MOST IMPORTAT THING (AT LEAST FOR ME): USE `css={[tw``]}` FOR DYNAMIC STYLES, AND USE `tw=""` OTHERVISE

## ANIMATIONS AND TRANSITIONS

FRAMER MOTION (SOMETIMES I DON'T LIKE HOW IT WORKS BECAUSE IT TENDS TO RANDOMLY SETS display PROPERTY) (IF YOU ARE ANIMATING SIZES)

## STATE MANGEMENT
